#City Navigation
**Overview**
The City Navigation and Driver Management System is designed to efficiently represent and manage city infrastructures as graphs. In this system, locations within a city are modeled as nodes, and the routes connecting them are represented as edges. Additionally, the system integrates functionality for managing driver information, making it ideal for applications such as ride-sharing, cab services, or urban transportation management.

**Core Components**
**1. Graph Representation**
Nodes: Represent individual locations or points of interest within a city.
Edges: Represent the routes or connections between locations. Each edge may have associated weights, such as distance or travel time.
**2. Driver Management**
Driver Information: Includes details about drivers such as names, vehicle types, and availability status.
Driver Assignment: Mechanisms for assigning drivers to specific locations or routes based on various criteria.
**Key Algorithms**
**Dijkstra's Algorithm**
**Purpose:** To find the shortest path between two nodes in the graph.
Application: Used for route optimization, helping users or systems identify the most efficient path between locations.
**Prim's Algorithm**
Purpose: To construct the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph.
Application: Useful for network optimization, such as planning the most cost-effective way to connect all locations within the city
